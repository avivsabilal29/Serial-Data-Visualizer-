# Serial Port Device

This folder contains code for the ESP32 board to simulate serial data, which is essential for the Serial Data Visualizer application. Below are the instructions to set up and use this code.

## Prerequisites
If you have not yet installed or built the Serial Data Visualizer application, please refer to one of the following:
- Navigate to the **`serial_data_visualizer_qt`**(if you are using Windows OS) or `serial_data_visualizer_ubunut`(if you are using ubuntu OS (Linux))  for building the application using Qt Creator.
- Navigate to the **`installer`** folder to directly install the pre-built application for Windows OS or Ubuntu OS (Linux).

## Code in this Folder
This folder contains two subfolders:
1. **`esp32_serial_data_simulation`**: Code for simulating serial data on the ESP32 board.
2. **`serial_data_code_test`**: Additional testing code for serial communication.

### Setting Up the ESP32 Board
1. Open the **Arduino IDE**.
2. Ensure you have the necessary ESP32 board package installed.
3. Open the code from the **`esp32_serial_data_simulation`** folder in the Arduino IDE.
4. Connect your ESP32 or Arduino board to your computer via USB.
5. Flash the code to the board.

### Next Steps
After successfully flashing the ESP32 board:
- Refer to the **documentation** folder in the main repository for detailed instructions on how to use the Serial Data Visualizer application.
