## Design Reflection

### Design Decisions
The design of the Serial Data Visualizer application was guided by the need for a user-friendly interface and robust performance. Below are the key design decisions made during the project:

1. **Modular Architecture:**
   - The application was designed with a modular architecture, separating concerns into different components such as serial communication, data visualization, and user interface. This separation ensures easier maintenance and scalability.

2. **Use of Qt Framework:**
   - Qt 6.2.4 was chosen for its cross-platform capabilities, extensive widget library, and support for real-time charting (Qt Charts) and serial communication (Qt Serial Port).

3. **Data Validation and Processing:**
   - The application includes robust validation mechanisms (e.g., LRC validation) to ensure only accurate data is processed and displayed.

4. **Real-Time Visualization:**
   - The integration of Qt Charts allows for smooth and dynamic data visualization, giving users immediate feedback on the incoming data.

5. **ESP32 Compatibility:**
   - The project was tailored to work seamlessly with ESP32, a widely-used microcontroller for IoT projects, ensuring relevance and adaptability.

6. **Installer Inclusion:**
   - To make the application accessible to non-technical users, an NSIS-based installer was provided alongside the source code.

### Challenges Faced
1. **Serial Communication Timing:**
   - Ensuring stable and accurate data retrieval from the ESP32 required fine-tuning of baudrate settings and buffer management.

2. **Data Synchronization:**
   - Handling real-time data updates on the chart while maintaining application responsiveness was a significant challenge.
   - The solution involved using separate threads for data processing and UI updates.

3. **Cross-Platform Build:**
   - Building and testing the application across different operating systems (Windows and Linux) highlighted compatibility issues, particularly with Qt libraries and MinGW.

4. **User Interface Consistency:**
   - Designing a user interface that is intuitive and consistent required multiple iterations and feedback sessions.

5. **ESP32 Firmware Stability:**
   - Ensuring the ESP32 firmware could reliably simulate and transmit data without errors was crucial for the applicationâ€™s functionality.

### Main Learnings
1. **Importance of Modular Design:**
   - A modular approach proved invaluable for debugging, testing, and future scalability. Breaking the application into smaller components allowed for easier identification and resolution of issues.

2. **Thread Management in Qt:**
   - Understanding how to effectively manage threads in Qt (e.g., for serial data handling) was a significant technical learning.

3. **User-Centric Development:**
   - Incorporating feedback from initial test users led to a more intuitive and efficient user experience.

4. **Tool Selection Impact:**
   - Choosing Qt as the development framework provided extensive functionality but required learning its intricacies to fully leverage its capabilities.

5. **Documentation Significance:**
   - Maintaining thorough documentation during development streamlined troubleshooting and will aid future developers working on the project.
